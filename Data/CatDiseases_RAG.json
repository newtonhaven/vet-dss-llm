White, or light colored, cats are more susceptible to squamous cell carcinoma. - Lymphosarcoma or lymphoma (LSA), is one of the most common type of cancer in cats. Some reports estimate that 30% of all reported cat cancers are due to LSA. Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is linked to most forms of LSA except for the gastrointestinal (GI) form.

AŌer a cat eats, her digestive system breaks food into various components, including glucose—which is carried into her cells by insulin. When a cat does not produce insulin or cannot utilize it normally, her blood sugar levels elevate. The result is hyperglycemia, which, if leŌ untreated, can cause many complicated health problems for a cat. It is important to understand that diabetes is considered a manageable disorder—and many diabetic cats can lead happy, healthy lives. Some may even go into remission! Diabetes can be classified as: - Type I (lack of insulin production) - Type II (impaired insulin production along with an inadequate response to the hormone). Cats with type II diabetes can progress to type I diabetes. In fact, by the time most cats are diagnosed with diabetes, they are identified as having the type I disorder. These cats require insulin therapy for survival. Cats with type II disease may respond to other forms of therapy.

Once your pet’s individual insulin treatment is established, typically based on weight, you will be shown how to give him his insulin injections at home. - Your vet may also show you how to perform glucose tests at home. Other routine blood work may also be necessary. As your veterinarian will explain, it’s important to always give your cat insulin at the same time every day and feed her regular meals in conjunction with her medication; this allows increased nutrients in the blood to coincide with peak insulin level.

No test is 100% accurate all of the time, and your veterinarian will interpret the test result and determine whether further testing is needed to confirm either a positive or negative test result. Once a cat is determined to be FIV-positive, that cat is capable of transmiƫng the disease to other cats. - Since it is possible for an infected mother cat to transfer FIV antibodies to her kittens, these kittens may test positive from their mother’s antibodies until they have cleared them from their systems, which happens by six months of age. Kittens who test positive for FIV antibodies when they’re younger than six months should undergo antibody tests again at a later date to see if they are infected. FIV Treatment Unfortunately, there is no specific antiviral treatment for FIV. Cats can carry the virus for a long time before symptoms appear. Therefore, treatment focuses mainly on extending the asymptomatic period or, if symptoms have set in, on easing the secondary effects of the virus. Your veterinarian may prescribe some of the following treatments: - Medication for secondary infections - Healthy, palatable diet to encourage good nutrition - Fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy - Anti-inflammatory drugs - Immune-enhancing drugs - Parasite control Caring for an FIV-Infected Cat - Keep your cat indoors. This will protect him from contact with disease-causing agents to which he may be susceptible. By bringing your cat indoors, you’re also protecting the uninfected cats in your community. - Watch for changes—even seemingly minor—in your cat’s health and behavior. Immediately report any health concerns to your vet. - Bring your cat to your vet at least twice per year for a wellness checkup, blood count and urine analysis. - Feed your cat nutritionally balanced food—no raw food diets, please, as bacteria and parasites in uncooked meat and eggs can be dangerous to immunocompromised pets. - Be sure your cat is spayed or neutered. Feline Leukemia Virus (FelV) First discovered in the 1960s, feline leukemia virus is a transmittable RNA retrovirus that can severely inhibit a cat’s immune system. It is one of the most commonly diagnosed causes of disease and death in domestic cats. Because the virus doesn’t always manifest symptoms right away, any new cat entering a household—and any sick cat—should be tested for FeLV. FeLV weakens an animal’s immune system and predisposes cats to a variety of infections and diseases, including anemia, kidney disease and lymphosarcoma, a highly malignant and fatal cancer of the lymph system. Young kittens and cats less than one year of age are most susceptible to the virus. Cats living with an infected cat, allowed outdoors where they may be bitten by an infected cat, and kittens born to a mother who is FeLV positive are most at risk for infection. - The FeLV virus is shed in many bodily fluids, including saliva, nasal secretions, urine, feces and blood. - FeLV is most commonly transmitted through direct contact, mutual grooming and through sharing litter boxes, food and water bowls. - It can also be passed in utero or through mother’s milk. - Infected outdoor cats fighting with other cats can transmit the disease through bites and scratches. Healthy cats over three months of age and vaccinated for FeLV are highly unlikely to contract the virus from another cat."

It’s not advisable to introduce a new uninfected cat into the household, even one who has been properly vaccinated against FeLV. Those living in close quarters with infected cats are most at risk for infection, and should be tested for the virus and, if negative, be housed separately. - FeLV is contagious to other cats, but not to humans or other species. Other cats in the house can acquire the virus from an infected cat. Though the virus doesn’t live long outside of the body, and is easily inactivated with common disinfectants, it can be passed through mutual grooming, shared food and water as well as common litter boxes. - Sadly there is no cure for FeLV, and it is estimated that less than 20% of clinically infected cats survive more than three years of active infection.

You may have thought heartworm disease only affects dogs, and it’s true that the infection is less common in cats.

    "text": "Because infection can potentially spread over a cat’s body, it is important that you see your vet for an accurate diagnosis if you suspect your pet has ringworm. And because the infection can easily spread to you and other animals in the household, it’s a smart idea to immediately quarantine your cat until a veterinarian can confirm a diagnosis. You should also thoroughly wash your hands aŌer you touch your cat. - Since some cats show few or no symptoms, a diagnosis of ringworm is rarely made just by looking at the skin. - A veterinarian may use an ultraviolet light to diagnose ringworm, or may examine a fungal culture taken from a cat’s hair or skin cells. - Skin biopsy and microscopic exam are sometimes also performed."

If your veterinarian has diagnosed your cat with ringworm, he or she will explain what you must do to prevent the fungus from spreading to your other pets—and to the human members of the household. But keep in mind that if you have other pets, it’s likely that most of them have been exposed as well. Your veterinarian may recommend that you do the following: - Bathe all pets in the household with a medicated rinse or shampoo. - Wash the infected animals’ bedding and toys with a disinfectant that kills ringworm spores. - Discard items that are impossible to thoroughly disinfect (carpeted cat trees, etc.) - Frequently vacuum to rid the house of infected hairs and skin cells. (Yes, the fungus can survive on hair and skin that your cat sheds!) - Thoroughly wash your hands aŌer you bathe or touch your cat. If a cat with ringworm is not properly treated, the lesions can spread over large areas of the animal’s body, causing hair loss and skin infections."

Chlamydia and Bordetella—commonly found in shelters and areas with multiple cats—are two such bacterial infections. - Less common in cats than dogs, Bordetella is usually associated with stress and overcrowded living conditions."

Sometimes cats demonstrate few to no outward signs of infection, and the infestation can go undetected despite being a potentially serious health problem. Some feline parasitic worms are hazards for human health as well. Common Types of Worms in Cats Outdoor cats and those who are routinely exposed to soil where other animals defecate are prone to worms. Kittens and cats who do not receive regular preventative health care are most at risk for developing complications associated with internal parasites. - Roundworms are the most common internal parasites in cats. Resembling spagheƫ, adult worms are three to four inches long. There are several ways cats can become infected. Nursing kittens can get roundworms from an infected mother’s milk, while adult cats can acquire them by ingesting eggs from the feces of an infected cat. - Hookworms are much smaller than roundworms—less than an inch long—and reside primarily in the small intestine. Because they feed on an animal’s blood, hookworms can cause life-threatening anemia, especially in kittens. Hookworm eggs are passed in the stool and hatch into larvae, and a cat can become infected either through ingestion or skin contact. - Tapeworms are long, flat, segmented parasites that range from 4 to 28 inches in length. An infestation can cause vomiting or weight loss. Cats acquire tapeworms by ingesting an intermediate host, like an infected flea or rodent."
