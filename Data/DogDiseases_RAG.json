When that loved one is your dog, it’s important to keep in mind that different veterinarians might have different views on the best way to treat the disease. It’s always a good idea to seek out a second opinion, perhaps from a veterinary oncologist, and carefully review your options. Cancer is a class of diseases in which cells grow uncontrollably, invade surrounding tissue and may spread to other areas of the body. As with people, dogs can get various kinds of cancer. The disease can be localized (confined to one area, like a tumor) or generalized (spread throughout the body)."

    "text": "Diabetes in dogs is a complex disease caused by either a lack of the hormone insulin or an inadequate response to insulin. AŌer a dog eats, his digestive system breaks food into various components, including glucose—which is carried into his cells by insulin, a hormone secreted by the pancreas. When a dog does not produce insulin or cannot utilize it normally, his blood sugar levels elevate. The result is hyperglycemia, which, if leŌ untreated, can cause many complicated health problems for a dog. It is important to understand that diabetes is considered a manageable disorder—and many diabetic dogs can lead happy, healthy lives. Diabetes can be classified as: - Type I (lack of insulin production) - Type II (impaired insulin production along with an inadequate response to the hormone). The most common form of the disease in dogs is Type I, insulin-dependent diabetes, which occurs when the pancreas is incapable of producing or secreting adequate levels of insulin. Dogs who have Type I diabetes require insulin therapy to survive. Diabetes Symptoms in Dogs The following are signs that your dog may be diabetic: - Change in appetite - Excessive thirst/increase in water consumption - Weight loss - Increased urination - Unusually sweet-smelling or fruity breath"

Diabetes treatment is based on how severe the signs of disease are and whether there are any other health issues that could complicate therapy. - Some dogs are seriously ill when first diagnosed and require intensive hospitalized care for several days to regulate their blood sugar levels. - Dogs who are more stable when first diagnosed may respond to oral medication or a high-fiber diet that helps to normalize glucose levels in the blood - For most dogs, insulin injections are necessary for adequate regulation of blood glucose. Once your pet’s individual insulin treatment is established, typically based on weight, you will be shown how to give him his insulin injections at home. - Spaying your dog is recommended, as female sex hormones can have an effect on blood sugar levels. As your veterinarian will explain, it’s important to always give your dog insulin at the same time every day and feed him regular meals in conjunction with his medication; this allows increased nutrients in the blood to coincide with peak insulin levels. This will lessen the chance that her sugar levels will swing either too high or too low. You can work with your vet to create a feeding schedule around your pet’s medication time. It is also important to avoid feeding your diabetic dog treats that are high in glucose. Regular blood glucose checks are a critical part of monitoring and treating any diabetic patient, and your veterinarian will help you set up a schedule for checking your dog’s blood sugar."
